# Motion-Detection-in-Live-Video-using-python-Open-CV
This Python script uses OpenCV to detect motion in a live video stream. It continuously compares the intensity of the blue channel at a specific pixel location with a reference image. If a change is detected, a counter increments, signaling potential motion. Pressing the 'c' key captures the current frame as a reference image
